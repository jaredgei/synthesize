                <div>Thank you for working with Synthesize Consulting LLC (“synthesize.consulting”, “Synthesize”, “synthesize consulting”, “we”, “us”, and terms of similar meaning). So that we can provide you or the entity you are signing on behalf of (“you”) with services that meet your expectations, please take the time to understand the following terms and conditions of use (these “Terms”). By making a purchase of our services (“Services”) on this website, any successor website (together, the “Site”) or through a custom invoice provided to you, you agree to be bound by these Terms, as amended from time to time. You represent and warrant to us that you have the capacity to enter into this legally binding agreement. Please note that the Terms below are relevant for the 300-Word Guidance and Yes/No Guidance. Ad Hoc Guidance terms will be decided on a per-case basis.</div>
                <div className='italic'>Commitment to collaboration, as necessary</div>
                <div>You, as the client, are an integral part of the management consulting experience and its outcomes. You may be asked follow up questions by synthesize.consulting. Your ability to provide accurate and prompt answers directly impacts our ability to produce quality outcomes in a timely manner. For the information you provide about yourself or your company, please note that we do not fact-check and rely on the accuracy and truthfulness of your statements and the materials which you provide to us. In instances where no response is received by you in a timely fashion (within 3 business days), synthesize.consulting can still issue guidance if we believe we can still provide a high quality response.</div>
                <div className='italic'>Timeline</div>
                <div>You will receive the guidance of your materials no later than 5 business days from receipt of payment and/or the receipt of any follow up question responses, as relevant, whichever is later. You will receive an email with the response to your outreach. By receiving that material, you are confirming that you are happy with our work and indicating to us that you are satisfied with the final product, unless you let us know otherwise. Any additional edits or services requested after require additional product purchases or ad hoc services.</div>
                <div className='italic'>100% Satisfaction Guaranteed for 300-Character Guidance</div>
                <div>Please note that this guarantee is only valid for the 300-Character Guidance product and not for Yes/No Guidance or Ad Hoc Guidance. We guarantee that you’ll be satisfied with the guidance, which means that we are committed to delivering an exceptional experience and a high-quality, final product. This may mean that the guidance you receive is not what you expected and/or is not the most convenient outcome for you or your organization. We maintain that our responses carry the utmost integrity, and will not issue refunds if you disagree with the outcomes. However, constructive feedback will be required to help improve our services going forward. If no constructive feedback is submitted within the refund window, the refund claim will be void.</div>
                <div>Our guarantee expires 7 calendar days after the response is received. You forfeit the right to our guarantee if you do not actively collaborate (as described above) during the process or provide requested information, as relevant. The guarantee is also forfeited in the absence of submitting constructive feedback related to the reason for a refund within the same 7 calendar day period. At any point during the 7-day window, please feel free to email us at info@synthesize.consulting with refund submissions, concerns, or questions.</div>
